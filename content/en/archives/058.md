This edition features a couple of storage related announcements. The EFS CSI driver is now available as a managed addon. For those who struggled to install the driver manually, this should make installing and upgrading the CSI driver a lot simpler from hereon. The second announcement is about Fargate's support for larger ephemeral volumes; as much as 200GB! 

The other big announcement is about a change in the pricing for public IPv4 address. Starting on 2/24, AWS will start charging .005 for public IPv4 addresses. Part of the reason for this change is that IPv4 addresses are scare resources nowadays. Since this scarcity can be alleviated by moving to IPv6 we've included a few links to IPv6 content to help prepare for the inevitable transition to v6.
