In this edition we feature exciting new launches such as Amazon EKS Auto Mode, Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes and operational enhancements such as launch of Node Health Monitoring and Auto-repair for Amazon EKS.

## New AWS services and features

* [Amazon EKS Auto Mode](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-eks-auto-mode/)
  * Amazon EKS Auto Mode fully automates Kubernetes cluster management for compute, storage, and networking on AWS with a single click. It simplifies Kubernetes management by automatically provisioning infrastructure, selecting optimal compute instances, dynamically scaling resources, continuously optimizing costs, managing core add-ons, patching operating systems, and integrating with AWS security services.
  * With Amazon EKS Auto Mode, you can leverage the scalability and operational excellence of AWS without deep Kubernetes expertise or ongoing infrastructure management overhead. By offloading cluster operations to AWS, you can get started quickly, improve performance, and reduce overhead, enabling you to focus on building applications that drive innovation rather than on cluster management tasks.
  * This [blog article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/streamline-kubernetes-cluster-management-with-new-amazon-eks-auto-mode/) serves as walkthrough guide to dive deep into capabilities of Amazon EKS Auto Mode.

* [Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-eks-hybrid-nodes/)
  * Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes unifies management of Kubernetes across cloud, on-premises and edge environments, giving you the flexibility to run your workloads anywhere, while driving higher availability, scalability, and efficiency.
  * It standardizes Kubernetes operations and tooling across environments and natively integrates with AWS services for centralized monitoring, logging, and identity management.
  * EKS Hybrid Nodes reduces the time and effort required for managing Kubernetes on premises and at the edge by offloading the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane to AWS. EKS Hybrid Nodes can run on your existing infrastructure to accelerate modernization without additional hardware investment.
  * This [blog article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/use-your-on-premises-infrastructure-in-amazon-eks-clusters-with-amazon-eks-hybrid-nodes/) serves as walkthrough guide to dive deep into capabilities of Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes.

* [Announcing Node Health Monitoring and Auto-Repair for Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/node-health-monitoring-auto-repair-amazon-eks/)
  * Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) now monitors the health of the EC2 instances (nodes) in EKS clusters for Kubernetes-specific health issues and automatically takes action to repair them if they become unhealthy.
  * You can enable this featureâ€™s health monitoring and repair capabilities by installing the new EKS node monitoring agent add-on in new or existing EKS clusters and then enabling node auto-repair in the EKS managed node group APIs or AWS Console.
  * EKS Auto Mode comes with both the node monitoring agent and node auto-repair enabled.
  * This [documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/node-health.html) serves as guide to dive deep into node monitoring agent and auto repair feature.
