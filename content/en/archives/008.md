Security is job 0 at AWS. We continue to hear from customers they're looking for ways to secure their Kubernetes environments. Here are some resources to help with securing Kubernetes clusters on AWS and your AWS account(s):

* [Security in Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/security.html)
* [Amazon EKS Best Practices Guide for Security](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/)
* [Cloud Security – Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/security/)
* [Vulnerability Reporting - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/)

This week we'll talk about Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights, AWS CloudFormation Hooks, and some of the latest nuggets from the greater cloud native ecosystem.

## New service announcements and features

[Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights adds support for Helm chart using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/amazon-cloudwatch-container-helm-chart-distro-opentelemetry/)

* New Helm chart for installing ADOT on EKS that sends metrics to CW
* Deploys ADOT Collector for collecting infrastructure metrics and Fluent Bit for logs
* [Documentation](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-helm-charts/tree/master/charts/adot-exporter-for-eks-on-ec2)

[AWS Announces the General Availability of AWS CloudFormation Hooks](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/aws-announces-general-availability-aws-cloudformation-hooks/)

* Customers can invoke custom logic to automate actions or inspect resource configurations prior to a CRUD operation operation, similar to Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controllers
* Customers can publish their policy and controls to the CloudFormation Registry and enforce them against all stack and resource operations in their AWS accounts
* [CloudFormation Public Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html)
* [CloudFormation Private Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html)

[Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights adds support for Amazon EKS Fargate using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/amazon-cloudwatch-eks-fargate-distro-opentelemetry/)

* ADOT collector runs as a sidecar and exports metrics to CW Container Insights
* [Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights-for-amazon-eks-fargate-using-aws-distro-for-opentelemetry/)
* [Documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/container-insights/eks-fargate)

[Proactively keep resources secure and compliant with AWS CloudFormation Hooks](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/proactively-keep-resources-secure-and-compliant-with-aws-cloudformation-hooks/)

* Solutions like Cloud Custodian, AWS Config, etc are reactive in that they alarm on resources that have already been created
* Hooks are meant to prevent the deployment of a resource when it violates your policy
* Hooks are similar to Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controllers, in that they run before a resource is created, updated, or deleted
* Blog explains how to create hooks of your own
* cloudformation-cli (cfn init and cfn generate) is used to create a project skeleton on your local machine
* [Samples](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-samples/tree/main/hooks)
* [Workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/f09fd78b-ef8a-4a9d-9d2b-f31a3e6ca956/en-US/)

* Each KoolKit uses (wherever possible) a language version manager instead of relying on language-specific distros

[Kubernetes Hardening Tutorial Part 3: Authn, Authz, Logging & Auditing](https://blog.gitguardian.com/kubernetes-tutorial-part-3-authn-authz/)
