## AWS Container Announcements

* [Networking Best Practices for EKS is now available](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/index/)
* [Announcing Workload Consolidation for Karpenter](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/workload-consolidation-karpenter/)
  * The long awaited consolidation feature is now available with Karpenter v0.15.0
  * Consolidation will automatically look for opportunities to reschedule workloads onto a set of more cost-efficient EC2 instances
  * For more information, visit [karpenter.sh](karpenter.sh)
* [Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) is now available in the Asia Pacific Region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/red-hat-openshift-service-aws-rosa-available-asia-pacific-jakarta-region/)
* [AWS Support launches support for managing cases in Slack](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/aws-support-launches-managing-cases-slack/)
  * Use the AWS Support App to collaborate with support agents on cases through Slack
  * See the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/aws-support-app-for-slack.html) for additional information

## AWS Container Blogs

* [Addressing IPv4 address exhaustion in Amazon EKS clsuters using private NAT gateways](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/addressing-ipv4-address-exhaustion-in-amazon-eks-clusters-using-private-nat-gateways/)
  * Describes different ways to address the IP exhaustion issue when running EKS
  * The private NAT gateway option allows instances in private subnets of a VPC to connect to other VPCs and on-premises networks with overlapping CIDR ranges
  * Since a peering connection cannot be used to connect VPCs with overlapping CIDRs, a transit gatway is necessary
  * Perform a thorough cost analysis based on AWS Transit Gateway pricing and assess whether the scale of your operations justifies the additional cost of using a transit gateway
* [Run event-driven workflows with Amazon EKS and AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/run-event-driven-workflows-with-amazon-eks-and-aws-step-functions/)
  * Event-driven architectures with [Smart Endpoints and Dump Pipes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/running-containerized-microservices/smart-endpoints-and-dumb-pipes.html) patterns further decouple services, which makes it easier to develop, scale, and maintain complex systems
  * They're efficient because they start when the event occurs and terminate when processing completes
  * This post describes how to use [Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/?step-functions.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&step-functions.sort-order=desc) to execute Kubernetes pods/jobs in response to an event
  * The walk-through illustrates how to use Step Functions/EKS to split a large file into smaller files and stores the results in an EFS file system
* [Deploying AWS Lambda functions using AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/deploying-aws-lambda-functions-using-aws-controllers-for-kubernetes-ack/)
  * With ACK for AWS Lambda, you can use manifest files to provision Lambda functions without creating separate process to deploy Lambda functions
  * This post walks you through deploying a sample Lambda function from a Kubernetes cluster provided by Amazon EKS
* [Using Kubernetes Migration Factory (KMF) to migrate from Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-kubernetes-migration-factory-kmf-to-migrate-from-google-kubernetes-engine-gke-to-amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-amazon-eks/)
  * Developed by AWS Professional Services, this tool can migrate Kubernetes resources and container images to EKS and ECR respectively
  * Although GKE is specifically called out, this tool can migrate from **any** Kubernetes cluster to EKS
  * The tool is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-kubernetes-migration-factory) under the Apache 2.0 license
