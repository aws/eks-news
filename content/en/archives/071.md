In this edition we feature Amazon EKS enhancements as it pertains to Upgrade Insights and Version availability metadata in EKS API.

## New AWS services and features

* [Amazon EKS expands catalog of upgrade insight checks](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-eks-catalog-upgrade-insights-checks/)
  * EKS upgrade insights automatically scan clusters against a list of potential Kubernetes version upgrade impacting issues.
  * EKS periodically updates the list of insight checks to perform, based on evaluations of changes in the Kubernetes project, as well as changes introduced in the EKS service along with new versions.
  * With these new enhancements, EKS upgrade insights will scan and warn on cluster health and version compatibility issues between different Kubernetes and EKS components such as kubelet, kube-proxy and EKS add-ons.

* [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus collector now support collecting metrics from IPv6 EKS clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-prometheus-collector-metrics-ipv6-eks-clusters/)
  * Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus collector, a fully-managed agentless collector for Prometheus metrics, now offers customers the option to collect metrics from an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service clusters using Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) in a dual stack VPC setup.
  * This [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-collector-how-to.html) serves as walkthrough guide to dive deep into capabilities of Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus collector.

* [Amazon EKS introduces programmatic access to Kubernetes version availability](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-eks-access-kubernetes-version-availability/)
  * Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) now lets you programmatically access availability of Kubernetes versions. This simplifies how you can discover and select available versions before creating or upgrading clusters.
  * With this launch, you can now programmatically retrieve Kubernetes version metadata, including support status and dates.
  * This [API reference page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusterVersions.html) serves as guide to dive deep into response syntax.
