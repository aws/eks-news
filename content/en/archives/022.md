This week, we'll cover the launch of Bare Metal for EKS Anywhere (üêªüé∏), 4x increase in control plane scaling/updating, EKS Observability Accelerator, and much more.

## New service announcements and features

[Announcing bare metal support for Amazon EKS Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/06/bare-metal-support-amazon-eks-anywhere/)

* Today, we are excited to announce the general availability of [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/) on bare metal which gives customers broader choice of infrastructure for running Kubernetes on-premises
* Amazon EKS Anywhere on bare metal enables customers to automate all steps from bare metal hardware provisioning to Kubernetes cluster operations using a bundled open source toolset built on the foundation of Tinkerbell and Cluster API
* Customers can optionally purchase [Amazon EKS Anywhere Subscriptions](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/pricing/) to get 24/7 support from AWS' highly-trained subject matter experts for Amazon EKS Anywhere cluster components as well as all bundled open source tooling

[AWS Fargate for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service is now available in the Amazon Web Services China Beijing and Ningxia Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/06/aws-fargate-elastic-kubernetes-beijing-ningxia-regions/)

* [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) for [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is now available in the Amazon Web Services China Beijing Region, operated by Sinnet, and the Amazon Web Services China Ningxia Region, operated by NWCD
* Using AWS Fargate serverless compute in your Amazon EKS clusters removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design

## New and notable blogs

[Introducing bare metal deployments for Amazon EKS Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-bare-metal-deployments-for-amazon-eks-anywhere/)

* At one time, all servers were bare metal servers
* We are excited to announce the general availability of Amazon EKS Anywhere on bare metal, which gives you a broader choice of deployment options for running Kubernetes on premises
* You [can configure](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/getting-started-with-eks-anywhere-on-bare-metal) server bootstrapping, cluster size, networking, storage, and software components through a workflow that uses [Tinkerbell](https://github.com/tinkerbell) (a Cloud Native Computing Foundation sandbox project)
* Once the cluster is provisioned, you can manage the cluster lifecycle using Amazon EKS Anywhere tooling built on the foundation of [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api)
* EKS Anywhere docs: <https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/docs/>

[Getting started with Amazon EKS Anywhere on Bare Metal](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/getting-started-with-eks-anywhere-on-bare-metal/)

* The new bare metal capability is provided in addition to the existing support for EKS Anywhere running on VMware
* Many customers have asked for the ability to run EKS Anywhere directly on hardware with no virtualization
* EKS Anywhere is fully open source and free to use
* It builds on a variety of existing, open-source projects such as, [Tinkerbell](https://tinkerbell.org/) for provisioning servers, [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for bootstrapping, and [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) for Kubernetes lifecycle managemen

[Amazon EKS improves control plane scaling and update speed by up to 4x](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-control-plane-auto-scaling-enhancements-improve-speed-by-4x/)

* When EKS launched in 2018, it aimed to reduce our customers' operational burden by offering a managed control plane for Kubernetes
* However, as usage of EKS grew, we discovered there were customers who occasionally exceeded the provisioned capacity of the cluster
* Today, the control plane is scaled automatically when certain metrics are exceeded
* Since introducing control plane auto scaling, we've been looking at ways to further improve the scaling experience for our customers
* With our latest updates, the control plane can now scale in 10 minutes or less, which represents a 4x improvement
* These updates will be applied to all new and existing clusters automatically, requiring no customer intervention

[Leverage AWS secrets stores from EKS Fargate with External Secrets Operator](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/leverage-aws-secrets-stores-from-eks-fargate-with-external-secrets-operator/)

* Secrets management is a challenging but critical aspect of running secure and dynamic containerized applications at scale
* Many customers choose to centralize the management of secrets outside of their Kubernetes clusters by using external secret stores such as [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) to improve the security, management, and auditability of their secret usage
* One example of how to accomplish this is by using the [AWS Secrets and Configuration Provider (ASCP)](https://github.com/aws/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-aws) for the [Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/)
* External Secrets will be deployed to your EKS cluster as a standard Kubernetes deployment, allowing Fargate to be used as your container compute provider
* Once configured, External Secrets will sync defined secrets from AWS Secrets Manager back to your EKS cluster
