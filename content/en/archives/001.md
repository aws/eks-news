Welcome to the second issue of EKS News! This week's newsletter contains info about using Crossplane and Flux, IPv6 EKS support, and the Cloud Native glossary.

## New and notable blogs

[GitOps model for provisioning and bootstrapping Amazon EKS clusters using Crossplane and Flux](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/gitops-model-for-provisioning-and-bootstrapping-amazon-eks-clusters-using-crossplane-and-flux/)

* Alternative to the solution described in part 1 of this series, [GitOps model for provision and bootstrapping Amazon EKS clusters using Crossplane and ArgoCD](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/gitops-model-for-provisioning-and-bootstrapping-amazon-eks-clusters-using-crossplane-and-argo-cd/) presents another way to implement GitOps in your environment
* Explains how to use Flux and Crossplane to provision and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes and AWS resources, e.g. EKS clusters
* The [example](https://github.com/aws-samples/eks-gitops-crossplane-flux) provisions a “workload” EKS cluster and subsequently deploys a workload onto that cluster using Flux/Crossplane
* Metrics from the application are surfaced in Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP)

[Amazon EKS launches IPv6 support](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-launches-ipv6-support/)

* Helps with IP exhaustion issues
* AWS VPC CNI has been updated to assign IPv6 addresses to pods when IPv6 is enabled
* Allows for IPv6 pods to communicate with other IPv6 or IPv4 resources residing inside or outside the cluster VPC
* ALB and NLB support dual-stack and can route requests to IPv6 services running within the cluster so long as the target type is set to IP
* Cannot configure an existing IPv4 cluster to use IPv6 (currently); will need to create a new cluster configured to use IPv6
* EKS Fargate also has support for IPv6; Windows and security groups for pods support are forthcoming
* Walkthrough explaining how to route traffic from the Internet to a Kubernetes service running on a cluster configured to use IPv6

[Connecting Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Clusters to Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/connecting-google-kubernetes-engine-gke-clusters-to-amazon-eks/)

* Walkthrough explaining how to connect a GKE cluster to the EKS console
* Provides a read-only view of objects within the connected cluster (currently)

## Ecosystem News

[Join the CNCF Cloud Native Glossary](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/01/11/join-the-cncf-cloud-native-glossary/)

* There are many acronyms in the CNCF ecosystem. The Cloud Native glossary aims to help with that.
* An excellent way for non-code contributors to get involved
* To update a term or contribute a new one, [follow these steps](https://glossary.cncf.io/contribute/). If you have any questions, hop on the #glossary channel on the CNCF Slack to ask for help.

[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2022 registrations is open](https://www.cncf.io/kubecon-cloudnativecon-events/)

* May 17-20, 2022, in Valencia, Spain
* [GitOpsCon Europe](https://www.cncf.io/events/gitopscon-europe/) is a Day 0 event you can register for now as well as many others
* Container Day information coming soon
* Hope to see you there!
