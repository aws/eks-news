No news is good news. If you're budding etymologist, this phrase can be attributed to the King James I, who wrote in 1616, 'No newis is bettir than evill newis.' That certainly applies to this edition of the EKS newsletter, at least insofar as EKS specific news is concerned. That's not to say we haven't been busy. In the last year we shipped 45 features and/or enhancements. That's almost 1 launch per week! Look for new updates in the coming weeks. 

## Ecosystem news
* [Why Kustomize?](https://whyk8s.substack.com/p/why-kustomize)
    * With overlays like Kustomize, the base file does not have to take into account future changes a developer may want to make. Overlays can change **any** property/value in the base. The burden of customizing the base essentially shifts to the consumer of the base.
* [Kubernetes Cluster Management with Monokle](https://monokle.io/blog/kubernetes-cluster-management-with-monokle) 
    * As a early user of Monokle for managing Helm and Kustomize files, I'm excited to see Kubeshop add cluster management features to Monokle.
    * [Infra.app](https://infra.app/), [aptakube](https://aptakube.com/), [k9s](https://k9scli.io/), and [octant](https://octant.dev/) are also good options. 
* [Advanced Secret Management on Kubernetes With Pulumi: Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://blog.ediri.io/advanced-secret-management-on-kubernetes-with-pulumi-secrets-store-csi-driver)
    * If you use Pulumi and want to use an external secret store for managing secrets like AWS Secrets Manager, this blog is for you!
* [The Flywheel Effect of Kubernetes APIs](https://thenewstack.io/the-flywheel-effect-of-kubernetes-apis/)
    * A good arguement for [Dapr](https://dapr.io/), a way to increase portability by abstracting 3rd party APIs from the developer. 
* [Top 15 Kubectl plugins for security engineers](https://sysdig.com/blog/top-15-kubectl-plugins-for-security-engineers/)
    * The top ~~10~~, I mean 15 kubectl plugins!
* [Service communication monitoring in Kubernetes with NetFlow](https://blog.palark.com/kubernetes-services-interaction-monitoring-with-netflow/)
    * Need to create a map of service interactions. Think that Istio and Cilium are overkill. Try NetFlow.
* [Service mesh 2022 recap: Linkerd adoption doubled, and what we learned about eBPF, the Gateway API, and more](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/01/20/service-mesh-2022-recap-linkerd-adoption-doubled-and-what-we-learned-about-ebpf-the-gateway-api-and-more/)
