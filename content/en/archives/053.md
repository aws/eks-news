A few weeks have past since we published our last newsletter. Since then, we've released a handful of new features, including a new open-source way to do identity and access management called Cedar. This edition also features a couple of interesting case studies from Conde Naste and Sentra. 

## New AWS services and features

* [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus now available in 4 additional AWS regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/05/amazon-managed-services-prometheus-4-regions/)
    * AMP is now available in Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), South America (Sao Paulo) and Europe (Paris)
* [Amazon EMR on EKS launches vertical autoscaling to auto-tune application resources](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/05/amazon-emr-eks-vertical-auto-scaling/)
    * EMR on EKS now supports vertical autoscaling, a feature to automatically tune the memory and CPU resources of EMR Spark Applications to adapt to the needs of the provided workload
    * Vertical autoscaling uses VPA to track resource utilization for EMR jobs. It specifically configures VPA to track the `container_memory_working_set_bytes` metric for the Spark executor pods that have vertical autoscaling enabled.
    * The major use-cases of vertical autoscaling is to aggregate usage data across different runs of EMR Spark jobs to derive resource recommendations. For additional information see [Improve reliability and reduce costs of your Apache Spark workloads with vertical autoscaling on EMR on EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/improve-reliability-and-reduce-costs-of-your-apache-spark-workloads-with-vertical-autoscaling-on-amazon-emr-on-eks/)
* [Amazon EMR on EKS now supports self-hosted notebooks for managed endpoints](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/05/amazon-emr-eks-self-hosted-notebooks-managed-endpoints/)
    * EMR on EKS now lets customers control the notebook execution environment, decide where it runs, and change how to access it
* [Introducing Cedar, an open-source language for access control](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/05/cedar-open-source-language-access-control/)
    * With Cedar, you can express fine-grained permissions as easy-to-understand policies enforced in your applications, and decouple access control from your application logic
    * It supports RBAC and ABAC and follows a new verification-guided development process to give you high assurance of Cedar’s correctness and security
    * For additional information see, [How we built Cedar with automated reasoning and differential testing](https://www.amazon.science/blog/how-we-built-cedar-with-automated-reasoning-and-differential-testing) and [Using Open Source Cedar to Write and Enforce Custom Authorization Policies](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-open-source-cedar-to-write-and-enforce-custom-authorization-policies/)

## AWS Blogs

* [How Condé Nast modernized its container platform on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/how-conde-nast-modernized-its-container-platform-on-amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service/)
    * [case study] This post discusses how Condé Nast modernized their container platform with Amazon EKS to support their growth, improved operational efficiency, and developer experience
* [How Sentra manages data workflows using Amazon EKS, Dagster, and Karpenter to maximize cost-efficiency with minimal operational overhead](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/how-sentra-manages-data-workflows-using-amazon-eks-dagster-and-karpenter-to-maximize-cost-efficiency-with-minimal-operational-overhead/)
    * [case study] This post explains how [Sentra](https://www.sentra.io/) utilizes a combination of [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/), [Spot](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/), [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/), and an open-source version of [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), a cloud-native orchestrator, to run efficient and scalable data processing workloads on AWS
* [Start Pods faster by prefetching images](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/start-pods-faster-by-prefetching-images/)
    * For shorter pull times, it may be advantageous to pre-cache images onto your worker nodes. This post proposes a design that allows you to pre-pull images on nodes without managing additional infrastructure or Kubernetes resources
    * The solution uses AWS Systems Manager [State Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-state.html) to cache container images on nodes. To keep the cache current, the solution uses an event-driven architecture to update the cache as new images get pushed to the image registry.
