AL2023 is finally here. Read about it in this week's edition of the newsletter. An EKS optimized AMI should be available in the coming months. 

**Attention readers**: On Monday, March 20th, traffic from the older k8s.gcr.io registry will be automatically redirected to registry.k8s.io with the eventual goal of sunsetting k8s.gcr.io. If you think you will be impacted by this change, please see *k8s.gcr.io Redirect to registry.k8s.io - What You Need to Know* under Community News. Please stop using k8s.gcr.io before the April 3rd deadline.
