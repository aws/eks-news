After our 3 week hiatus and a restful Thankgiving holiday, we're glad to be back, at least until the next round of holidays. This week's newsletter is longer than normal because it includes updates that have occurred since our last edition was published. Enjoy!

## AWS announcements

* [AWS Nitro Enclaves now supports Amazon EKS and Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/aws-nitro-enclaves-supports-amazoneks-kubernetes/)
    * You can use Kubernetes to orchestrate, scale, and deploy containers to run in EC2 Enclaves.
    * The [Nitro Enclaves Kubernetes Device Plug-in](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-k8s-device-plugin) gives Kubernetes the ability to manage the lifecycle of an enclave. See [Using Enclaves with Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/kubernetes.html) for further information.
    * Improves upon an earlier hack described in this [blog](https://superorbital.io/journal/aws-nitro-enclaves-in-k8s-pods/) by Superorbital.
* [AWS Marketplace for containers now supports direct deployment to EKS clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/aws-marketplace-containers-direct-deployment-eks-clusters/)
    * Adds the ability to deploy operational software from marketplace directly to EKS clusters
    * Provides lifecycle management for 3rd party addons like Nirmata’s Kyverno Enterprise, Tetrate’s Istio offering, Kubecost, among others.
    * Addons makes use of Server Side Apply which was featured in 2 recent posts on the Kubernetes blog: 
        * [Live and let live with Kluctl and Server Side Apply](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/11/04/live-and-let-live-with-kluctl-and-ssa/)
        * [Server Side Apply Is Great And You Should Be Using It](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/10/20/advanced-server-side-apply/)
* [Amazon EMR on EKS adds support for configuring Spark properties within EMR Studio Jupyter Notebooks](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/emr-eks-configuring-spark-properties-emr-studio-jupyter-notebooks/)
    * Adds support for configuring Spark properties within EMR Studio Jupyter Notebook sessions for interactive Spark workloads
    * Users can customize their Spark settings, such as driver and executor CPU/memory, number of executors, and package dependencies, within a notebook session.
* [AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces is now integrated with CloudHedge OmniDeq to speed container modernization](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/aws-migration-hub-refactor-spaces-integrated-cloudhedge-omnideq-speed-container-modernization/)
    * Customers can use Migration Hub Refactor Spaces with [CloudHedge OmniDeq](https://cloudhedge.io/) to replatform applications into containers and deploy them directly into refactoring environments
    * Refactor Spaces automates the creation of application refactor environments so that customers do not need to build the AWS infrastructure, multi-account networking, and routing for modernization. CloudHedge OmniDeq is a low/no code platform that automates assessment of legacy application architectures and topology, securely containerizes legacy applications, and deploys them onto managed container services like EKS.
* [AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) controller for Amazon EMR on EKS is now generally available](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/ack-controller-amazon-emr-eks/)

    * A new image for AWS Fluent Bit is available for Windows Server on Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, allowing logs from Windows machines to be forwarded to various AWS and third-party destinations such as Amazon CloudWatch, S3, Kineses Firehose, Datadog, and Splunk
* [Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS Distro now support Kubernetes version 1.24](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-eks-eks-distro-support-kubernetes-version-1-24/)
    * Notable changes include: the removal of dockershim, the addition of topology aware hints, and support for PSS/PSA. 

## AWS container blogs

* [Managing access to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service clusters with X.509 certificates](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/managing-access-to-amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-clusters-with-x-509-certificates/)
    * Describes how to use [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) to authenticate to EKS using an x.509 certificates
    * Exchanges an x.509 certificate for a set of temporary AWS credentials
    * Uses `aws_signing_helper` to facilitate the exchange
* [Managing Pod Security on Amazon EKS with Kyverno](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/managing-pod-security-on-amazon-eks-with-kyverno/)
    * Illustrates how to use Kyverno to implement cluster-wide PSS/PSA policies, how to grant policy exceptions to pods deployed into namespaces with restrictive PSS/PSA policies, and extend Pod security checks to pod controllers like Deployments
* [Transparent encryption of node to node traffic on Amazon EKS using WireGuard and Cilium](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/transparent-encryption-of-node-to-node-traffic-on-amazon-eks-using-wireguard-and-cilium/)
    * This blog explores a lighter weight option that provides encryption for data in transit that is built into the newer versions of the Linux kernel
    * Requires the Cilium CNI to be chained to VPC CNI
    * Aside from Cilium, you can also use certain instances from the Nitro family (traffic exchange between these instances is automatically encrypted using TLS)
* [Microservices development using AWS controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) and Amazon EKS blueprints](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/microservices-development-using-aws-controllers-for-kubernetes-ack-and-amazon-eks-blueprints/)
    * Walks through creating a composite application using ACK and EKS blueprints.
    * The sample application uses a DynamoDB table as storage provisioned by the ACK DynamoDB controller. It then uses the ACK API Gateway controller to create an API Gateway HTTP API with a [route](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-routes.html) linking to the sample application through VpcLink.

    * AWS Fluent Bit image support for Windows eliminates the need for Windows customers to implement any custom logging solutions in their application code or manage custom agents on their Windows nodes to scrape the logs
    * The blog covers how customers can deploy Fluent Bit Windows images as a DaemonSet on their Windows nodes to stream Internet Information Services (IIS) logs generated in the Windows pods to CloudWatch logs as a way to centralize logging
