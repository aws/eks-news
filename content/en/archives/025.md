A relatively quiet news week on the EKS front. AWS published 2 interesting blogs. The first is on using promxy to query across multiple instances of Prometheus. The other covers the latest features that have been added to Karpenter. Thanks to AWS Container Hero [Lukonde Mwila](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/lukonde-mwila/) for writing it! If you don't have plans this weekend we've added lots of ecosystem news in this edition to keep you busy.  

## New and notable EKS Blogs

* [Visualizing metrics across Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspaces using Amazon Managed Grafana](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/visualizing-metrics-across-amazon-managed-service-for-prometheus-workspaces-using-amazon-managed-grafana/)
  * provides step-by-step instructions for aggregating and visualizing your  [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) monitoring metrics using [AMP](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/) and [AMG](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/) across multiple Prometheus workspaces using [promxy](https://github.com/jacksontj/promxy)
  * Promxy works similar to database proxies like ProxySQL for MySQL

* [Scaling Kubernetes with Karpenter: Advanced Scheduling with Pod Affinity and Volume Topology Awareness](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/scaling-kubernetes-with-karpenter-advanced-scheduling-with-pod-affinity-and-volume-topology-awareness/)

  * Describes an enterprise deployment where the Kong Control Plane runs on an EKS cluster in the cloud while the Kong Data Plane runs on EKS-A clusters on-premises, allowing you to push Kong Services and Routes to EKS-A clusters downstream.
  * Data Planes can make use of Cogito for OIDC based authN and other AWS services.

* [Solution Highlight: Capital One](https://isovalent.com/isovalent-capital-one/?utm_source=GaggleAMP-Isovalent)

  * Operating 900+ on-premises clusters
  * “We put a lot of effort into doing things in a way where we are able to manage it. For us, the surrounding systems are working well if we are managing 500 clusters, or 1,000, because everything is automated … If we were to add 500 more clusters, we would have to add just one more engineer.”
  * CAPI and DevOps were essential for running k8s at scale
  * Preparing to start moving more workloads to the public cloud
  * Working on creating a central developer portal with Backstage

* [Two reasons Kubernetes is so complex](https://buttondown.email/nelhage/archive/two-reasons-kubernetes-is-so-complex/)

    * k8s will gradually fade into the background as the community builds platforms on top of it
    * Developers will transition to OIDC for workload identities from k8s secrets
    * As service meshes mature, they will become the de facto way to create networks across clusters and clouds
    * Deployments will give way to the Knative-like service resources for routing events
    * Developers will build applications that are largely stateless

* [K8s Gateway API is here - what’s in it for you?](https://www.groundcover.com/blog/k8s-gateway-api)
