In this issue, we’ll go over using AWS Proton for provisioning Amazon EKS, Mobileye's usage of Amazon EKS (1000s of nodes), the differences between Docker, containerd, CRI-O and runc, and more.

## New service announcements and features

[Metric support now available in AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/05/aws-distro-opentelemetry-metric-support/)

* Today, we are announcing the general availability of [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws.amazon.com/otel/) (ADOT) for metrics, a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project
* [C]ustomers can use OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs in Java, .Net, and JavaScript to collect and send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, and other monitoring destinations supported by the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)
* [P]art of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), OpenTelemetry provides open source APIs, libraries, and agents to collect distributed traces and metrics for application and infrastructure monitoring

## New and notable blogs

[Using AWS Proton as a provisioning mechanism for Amazon EKS clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-aws-proton-as-a-provisioning-mechanism-for-amazon-eks-clusters/)

* AWS customers have a number of options they can use to deploy Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters
* If you are part of a team responsible for creating standards and governance for deployments while providing developers with self-service provisioning of Kubernetes clusters, this blog post is for you
* [W]alk you through the benefits and the mechanics of using AWS Proton as a vending machine for Amazon EKS clusters
* In a [separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/eks-blueprints-for-proton), we provide detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to create a vending configuration and deploy your first cluster

[Mobileye’s journey towards scaling Amazon EKS to thousands of nodes](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/mobileyes-journey-towards-scaling-amazon-eks-to-thousands-of-nodes/)

* Mobileye develops self-driving technology and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) using state-of-the-art cameras, computer chips, and software
* The managed service and managed node groups of [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) allowed us to focus on the workload instead of infrastructure, given a well-designed architecture based on our needs
* Given the Amazon EKS architecture, our developers are not and should not be aware of the node group setup, Availability Zones, or any other aspects. To achieve that abstraction, we are using [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/).
* One of the significant improvements that [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/docs/) brings is fast scaling (the time between the pod being created and the pod reaching a running state) and the fact that it does not require node groups, which at the scale of our architecture, can be challenging to manage.

[Customizing scheduling on Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/customizing-scheduling-on-amazon-eks/)

* This post demonstrates how you can use a mutating pod admission webhook to customize pod scheduling across nodes
* You can use this solution for a variety of use cases such as prioritizing nodes in an Availability Zone to reduce data transfer costs, spreading workloads across Availability Zones, or running workloads across On-Demand and Spot instances

[Using SMB CSI Driver on Amazon EKS Windows nodes](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/modernizing-with-aws/using-smb-csi-driver-on-amazon-eks-windows-nodes/)

* In April 2022, we started shipping the [Amazon EKS Optimized Windows AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-windows-ami.html) together with the [CSI Proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-proxy), which enables customers to use CSI drivers on Windows nodes
* With this new release, customers now can use the [SMB CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-smb) on Windows nodes to access [Amazon FSx for Windows File Server](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/?nc=sn&loc=2), [Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP SMB Shares](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/netapp-ontap/), and/or [AWS Storage Gateway – File Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/file/?nc=sn&loc=2&dn=2)
* In this blog post, we will walk you through the steps to correctly install SMB CSI Driver on Amazon EKS Windows node groups

[Using IAM database authentication with workloads running on Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-iam-database-authentication-with-workloads-running-on-amazon-eks/)

* When running containerized workloads on Amazon EKS, it is common to store the stateful parts of the application outside of the Kubernetes cluster in one or more SQL or NoSQL databases
* With Amazon Relational Database Service ([Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)) and [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), the whole process of managing user access credentials can be simplified by using [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authenticating to the database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html)
* In this blog post, we will demonstrate IAM database authentication with Amazon EKS by deploying a sample application and storing the state in an Amazon Aurora MySQL database
