This week in Kubecon EU. If you happen to be going, stop by the AWS booth and say "hello". The big news this week was the release of EKS v1.26 which also happened to coincide with Kubernetes v1.27.

Amazon will be hosting Container Day on April 18th! Topics include cost optimization, monitoring and logging, governance/compliance, and GitOps. [Register](https://aws-kubecon-eu.splashthat.com/?trk=24df752a-80e4-4dd4-84a9-f55c30e4e8bb&sc_channel=sm) today. 

## New AWS services and features
* [Amazon EMR on EKS is now available in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-emr-eks-middle-east-asia-pacific-regions/)
* [Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS Distro now support Kubernetes version 1.26](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-eks-distro-kubernetes-version-1-26/)
    * [Amazon EKS now supports Kubernetes version 1.26](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-now-supports-kubernetes-version-1-26/)
    * It has been about 50 days between the release of EKS v1.25 and EKS v1.26. Now that it's here, there are a few important things you need to know. First, upgrade the VPC CNI to v1.12 or higher _before_ upgrading your cluster to v1.26. Second, before upgrading to EKS v1.26, upgrade to containerd v1.6 or higher. If you're on the the latest version of the EKS Optimized AMI, it already includes containerd v1.6.19. Third, verify that your HPA policies are no longer referencing the `autoscaling/v2beta2` API. The `v2beta2` API has been removed in EKS v1.26.

    * This blog describes Matilda Cloud's migration service which you can use to identify your application's dependencies, calculate its resource requirements, and create a e2e orchestation to migrate your applications to AWS without distruption or downtime.  
* [How Excelfore Uses the AWS Cloud to Develop and Deliver Continuous Software Updates for Software Defined Vehicles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/how-excelfore-uses-the-aws-cloud-to-develop-and-deliver-continuous-software-updates-for-software-defined-vehicles/)
    * Similar to the Air Force's use of Kubernetes in the [F16 fighter](https://www.cncf.io/case-studies/dod/), Excelfore is using Kubernetes in the vehicle to streamline operations, lower costs, and improve their ability to introduce new innovations faster
    * The blog describes the architecture Excelfore devised for OTA updates to the vehicle and their use of "a digital twin", a stack that mimicks the behavior of an physical vehicle, for running tests in the cloud
