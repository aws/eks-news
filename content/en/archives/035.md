You are invited to the [AWS Container Day featuring Kubernetes](https://pages.awscloud.com/AWSContainerDayFtKubernetes.html?trk=f523db47-3867-4ec9-b9a5-3c0001083550&sc_channel=sm) an official Co-Located Event at KubeCon NA 2022 in Detroit, Michigan. AWS Container Day is free for KubeCon attendees but pre-event registration is still required. 

There are two separate sessions requiring separate registration (Morning/AM session and Afternoon/PM session).  Registration at one session does not grant access to the other (i.e., an individual who signs up for the AM session will be denied access to the PM session unless they register for that session as well). Attendees should register for morning session, afternoon session, or both when they [sign up for KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/register/) OR [update their registration](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/register/) to include the event. Co-Located Event signup is the 4th step in registration (under registration options).

If you're attending the conference in person, you can sign up to meet with an AWS expert by filling out this [form](https://awscustomerprograms.jifflenow.com/external-request/kubeconnamerica2022/meeting-request?token=ba67ba031be65e0c0674).

* [Getting visibility into your Amazon EKS Cross-AZ pod to pod network bytes](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/getting-visibility-into-your-amazon-eks-cross-az-pod-to-pod-network-bytes/)
    * It's common for pods to communicate with other pods across multiple distinct AZs and generate cross-availability zone (cross-AZ) data transfer.
    * A key challenge that customers face is reasoning cross-AZ pod-to-pod network communication patterns and their associated sum of network bytes.
    * In this post, we show you a solution based on querying and joining two data sources: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs and an extracted Amazon EKS cluster pods metadata list. The query creates a cross-AZ pod-to-pod network flow table view (including a sum of the egress network bytes).

    * AWS has now migrated all the latest (September 2022) container-optimized Windows Server AMIs to use Docker Community Edition (CE). This change is to help customers avoid paying additional costs to get continued support, bug fixes and security patches for Mirantis Container Runtime with the Microsoft [announcement](https://www.mirantis.com/docker-engine-enterprise-support/) to transfer support for Mirantis Container Runtime to Mirantis at the end of September 2022.
