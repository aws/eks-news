For those of you who were able to attend KubeCon EU or AWS Container Day, we hope you had a learned a few things while you were in Amsterdam. This week we feature a couple of blogs about different use cases for service meshes: intelligent routing and service migration. We've also included a post on CodeCatalyst, a new-ish service that help developers create workflows and manage code projects. 
 
Announcement: Version 2.5 of the AWS Load Balancer Controller sets the `enableServiceMutatorWebhook` to true. This makes the controller the default for all services of type LoadBalancer. Unless you change this value to false, the controller will always provision a Network Load Balancer (NLB) for services of type LoadBalancer. If you need to run the AWS Load Balancer Controller _and_ want to use a Classic Load Balancer (CLB) for services of type Load Balancer, set `enableServiceMutatorWebhook` to false in the [helm chart](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/blob/ff8c13d4cc368f8073421a46918cadd7c0fc760a/helm/aws-load-balancer-controller/values.yaml#L352-L353).

## AWS Blogs
* [Managing edge-aware Service Mesh with Amazon EKS for AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/managing-edge-aware-service-mesh-with-amazon-eks-for-aws-local-zones/)
    * For certain use cases, it is preferrable to deploy services at the edge. With AWS Wavelengths and Local Zones you can extend EKS clusters to the edge, however, direct communication between services in different Local/Wavelength zones is forbidden. This blog describes how you can use HashiCorp's Consul Mesh to intelligently route and fail-over traffic to services running in the parent region when services are distributed across multiple zones (Local Zones, and Wavelengths). 
* [Tradeshiftâ€™s migration to Amazon EKS without downtime using Linkerd](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/tradeshifts-migration-to-amazon-eks-without-downtime-using-linkerd/)
    * This blog describes how Tradeshift was able to gradually migrate services from a self-managed Kubernetes cluster to Amazon EKS without downtime using the Linkerd service-mesh and its multi-cluster capabilities
    * Tradeshift decided to use Linkerd due to its lightweight nature and efficient resource usage. Linkerd also allowed Tradeshift to better understand the performance of their services, and also gain insights into their services during migration to ease identification of any issues.
* [Multi-Architecture Container Builds with CodeCatalyst](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/multi-architecture-container-builds-with-codecatalyst)
    * [Amazon CodeCatalyst](https://aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/) is a new AWS service for version control, project tracking, and CI/CD. This blog describes how to create a workflow in CodeCatalyst that generates a multi-architecture image and pushes it to ECR. 
* [Use IAM roles to connect GitHub Actions to actions in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-iam-roles-to-connect-github-actions-to-actions-in-aws)
    * This blog explains how to use an OIDC provider for GitHub to issue temporary credentials, allowing GitHub Actions to call specific AWS services in your account. Common actions for workflows include calling AWS Lambda functions or pushing files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
