The dog days of summer: Last week the editorial staff for the newsletter was vacation. If you can afford to, we highly recommend taking time away from work to decompress and relax. The big news this week is the release of EKS 1.23!

## AWS Container Blogs

* [Running Workload on Amazon EKS in Local Zones with a failover strategy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/running-workload-on-amazon-eks-in-local-zones-with-resilient-architecture/)
  * AWS gives you the ability to deploy infrastructure to local zones, including EKS worker nodes
  * Local zones are often used to reduce latency or address data residency requirements
  * Since local zones are single zones, you may need to modify your architecture to achieve high availability
  * This blog describes how to design your infrastructure to be highly available when deploying applications, e.g. Wordpress, onto worker nodes in local zones
* [How to containerize legacy code into Red Hat OpenShift on AWS (ROSA)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/how-to-containerize-legacy-code-into-red-hat-openshift-on-aws-rosa/)
  * This blog shows how to containerize a COBOL application and run it as a `cron` job on a ROSA cluster
  * The solution uses [GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) an open source COBOL compiler for Linux
* [Using Amazon EBS snapshots for persistent storage with your Amazon EKS cluster by leveraging add-ons](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-amazon-ebs-snapshots-for-persistent-storage-with-your-amazon-eks-cluster-by-leveraging-add-ons/)
  * Kubernetes Volume Snapshots lets you create a copy of your EBS volumes at a specific point in time
  * This blog describes how to use the volume snapshots feature to create and attach a volume snaphot to a pod
  * You can use snapshots to migrate from gp2 to gp3 as described in this [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/migrating-amazon-eks-clusters-from-gp2-to-gp3-ebs-volumes/)
* [Announcing CDK for Terraform on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/announcing-cdk-for-terraform-on-aws/)
  * The [Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)](https://www.terraform.io/cdktf) is a result of a collaboration with Hashicorp that began 2 years ago
  * Built on top of the open source JSII library, CDK for Terraform allows you to write Terraform configurations in your choice of C#, Python, TypeScript, Java, or Go and still benefit from the full ecosystem of Terraform providers and modules
  * You can write your own abstractions to share with your team, or you can browse [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/) to discover open source construct libraries for all CDKs
  * Check out this eks [demo](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/enable-self-service-aws-eks-deployments-with-cdk-for-terraform)
