## Ecosystem News

[Twitter Space: Amazon EKS OP1 feedback](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1rmxPgmnLNmJN)

* Justin Garrison is running a Twitter Space that the community can give feedback directly to DAs and PMs working on EKS as we plan priorities for the next year.

[Istio has applied to become a CNCF project](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2022/istio-has-applied-to-join-the-cncf/)

* The Istio project is pleased to announce its intention to join the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
* It is almost 5 years since Google, IBM and Lyft launched Istio 0.1 in May 2017
* The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee will carefully consider our application, and perform due diligence. After that, they’ll open up for a vote, and if successful, the project will be transferred.

[v3.5 data inconsistency postmortem](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/postmortems/v3.5-data-inconsistency.md)

* Summary: Code refactor in v3.5.0 resulted in consistent index not being saved atomically. Independent crashes could lead to committed transactions not reflected on all the members.
* Impact: No user reported problems in production as triggering the issue required frequent crashes, however the issue was critical enough to motivate a public statement. Main impact comes from losing user trust into etcd reliability.

[WEBINAR: Manage with Ease: Application Portability on EKS with Weave GitOps](https://go.weave.works/Webinar-AWS-Application-Portability-OnDemand.html?LSD=On-Demand&CampaignID=7014M000001zT70QAE&LeadSource=Partner?utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=eks-news-015)

In this webinar, you will learn:

* How to reduce complexity so a small team can manage large fleets of clusters running in diverse cloud providers as well as on premises
* How to make it easy for your development teams to deliver their applications securely and consistently, regardless of the target environment
* When fixing the main data inconsistency we have found multiple other edge cases that could lead to data corruption
* There's a list of action items to be implemented to help mitigate this in the future.
