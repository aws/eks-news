You are invited to the [AWS Container Day featuring Kubernetes](https://pages.awscloud.com/AWSContainerDayFtKubernetes.html?trk=f523db47-3867-4ec9-b9a5-3c0001083550&sc_channel=sm) an official Co-Located Event at KubeCon NA 2022 in Detroit, Michigan. AWS Container Day is free for KubeCon attendees but pre-event registration is still required. 

There are two separate sessions requiring separate registration (Morning/AM session and Afternoon/PM session).  Registration at one session does not grant access to the other (i.e., an individual who signs up for the AM session will be denied access to the PM session unless they register for that session as well). Attendees should register for morning session, afternoon session, or both when they [sign up for KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/register/) OR [update their registration](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/register/) to include the event. Co-Located Event signup is the 4th step in registration (under registration options).

If you're attending the conference in person, you can sign up to meet with an AWS expert by filling out this [form](https://awscustomerprograms.jifflenow.com/external-request/kubeconnamerica2022/meeting-request?token=ba67ba031be65e0c0674).

## AWS Container Announcements
* [Bottlerocket is now supported by Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/09/bottlerocket-supported-amazon-inspector/)
    * Supports Bottlerocket versions >= 1.7.0.
    * Inspector scans Bottlerocket and container workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. 
    * Amazon Inspector leverages the AWS System Manager (SSM) agent to scan for vulnerabilities. In Bottlerocket hosts, the SSM agent runs within the control host container, so you need to make sure it is enabled in your hosts.

## AWS Container Blogs
* [EKS on Outposts now supports Local Clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-on-aws-outposts-now-supports-local-clusters/)
    * With the local clusters deployment option, you can run the entire EKS cluster locally on the Outposts appliance to mitigate the risk of temporary network disconnects to the cloud, such as those caused by fiber cuts or weather events.
    * This post provides an overview of the local cluster architecture, how to use local clusters, and a step-by-step procedure for deploying local clusters, nodes, and applications on AWS Outposts.
* [Scaling EKS and Cassandra beyond 1000 nodes](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/scaling-amazon-eks-and-cassandra-beyond-1000-nodes/)
    * Datastax prepared for running Cassandra at scale on AWS by: 
        * Increasing AWS service limits such as EC2, VPC, and ELB limits
        * Using Kubernetes 1.21+, Kernel version 5.9+, VPC CNI 1.9+, and Nitro instances
        * Implemting IPVS
        * Using containerd as the runtime and setting max pods explicity
        * Using the proportal autoscaler with CoreDNS
* [Enabing tiering and throttling in a multi-tenant EKS SaaS solution using API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/enabling-tiering-and-throttling-in-a-multi-tenant-amazon-eks-saas-solution-using-amazon-api-gateway/#awssaasfactory)
    * In a multi-tenant environment, you often have to be concerned about noisy neighbor conditions where the load of one tenant can adversely impact the load of another tenant.
    * This post looks at the different strategies that can be used to introduce the throttles and quotas (transaction volume) that manage each tenantâ€™s activity, exploring the various AWS services, like API Gateway, that can be used to bring these concepts to life.
