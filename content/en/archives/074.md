In this edition we feature several exciting announcements related to Amazon EKS including but not limited to Amazon EKS support for Kubernetes version 1.33, launch of most anticipated Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers and centralized EKS Dashboard

## New AWS services and features

* [Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS Distro now supports Kubernetes version 1.33](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/amazon-eks-distro-kubernetes-version-1-33/)
  * Amazon EKS now supports Kubernetes version 1.33 in all the AWS Regions where EKS is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.
  * Kubernetes version 1.33 includes stable support for sidecar containers, topology-aware routing and traffic distribution, and consideration of taints and tolerations when calculating pod topology spread constraints, ensuring that pods are distributed across different topologies according to their specified tolerance.
  * This release also adds support for user namespaces within Linux pods, dynamic resource allocation for network interfaces, and in-place resource resizing for vertical scaling of pods.

* [Announcing new Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers for AWS Serverless and Containers](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/new-model-context-protocol-servers-aws-serverless-containers/)
  * Model Context Protocol(MCP) servers are a standard interface to enhance AI-assisted application development by equipping AI code assistants with real-time, contextual understanding of AWS service in interaction.
  * With this launch, there are now new MCP servers to interact with Amazon EKS in addition to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Lambda and Finch.
  * With MCP servers integrated into AI code assistants such as Amazon Q Developer, while building applications on Amazon EKS developers can now use natural language to describe their requirements while AI code assistants handle service configurations, infrastructure setup, and cross-service integrations.To learn more, navigate to [documentation here](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/eks-mcp-server/)

* [Announcing EKS Dashboard, a multi-cluster view of Kubernetes infrastructure across AWS Regions and your AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/eks-dashboard-multi-cluster-view-kubernetes-infrastructure-aws-regions-organizations/)
  * As you expand your Kubernetes footprint to address operational and strategic objectives, such as improving availability, ensuring business continuity, isolating workloads, and scaling infrastructure, centralized visibility across your Kubernetes infrastructure would be an essential requirement.
  * With this launch, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) now offers EKS Dashboard, a centralized dashboard that can provide visibility across multiple AWS regions and accounts.

* [Amazon EKS introduces configuration insights for Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/amazon-eks-configuration-insights-eks-hybrid-nodes/)
  * Amazon EKS cluster insights provide detection of issues and recommendations to resolve them to help you manage your cluster.Amazon EKS provides two types of insights: Configuration insights and Upgrade insights.
  * With this launch of Configuration Insights, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) now offers help in identifying misconfigurations in your EKS Hybrid Nodes setup that could impair functionality of your cluster or workloads.

* [Amazon Inspector enhances container security by mapping ECR images to running containers](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/amazon-inspector-container-security-images/)
  * Amazon Inspector now automatically maps your Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) images to specific pods running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), helping identify where the images are actively in use.
  * With this launch, you can use Amazon Inspector console or APIs to identify your actively used container images, when you last used an image, and which clusters are running the image, thereby focusing resources on patching most critical vulnerable images and improving mean-time to remediation.
