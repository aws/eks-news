Not long ago, I kicked off some [discussions in the OpenGitOps project](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/discussions) around issues EKS customers have been encountering while implementing GitOps. If you're not aware, "[OpenGitOps](https://github.com/open-gitops/project) is a [CNCF sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/) to define a vendor-neutral, principle-led meaning of GitOps. This will establish a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance, and certification through lasting programs, documents, and code." The three discussions are around [Secrets management](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/discussions/96), [progressive delivery](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/discussions/93), and the concept of [management clusters](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/discussions/95).

I have [strong opinions about secret management](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/discussions/96#discussioncomment-2425316). Maybe you have strong opinions about progressive delivery? Feel free to take part in any of these conversations. All you need is a GitHub account and your knowledge. Feedback from folks implementing GitOps in their organizations is much appreciated. Feel free to bring your questions too. OpenGitOps is trying to capture use cases as well as best practices to formulate better guidance for GitOps implementations.
