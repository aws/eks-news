In this edition we feature several blogs on GPUs and how you can use them efficiently when running certain types of workloads. 

## New AWS services and features
* [Amazon EMR on EKS now supports managed Apache Flink (Public Preview)](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/09/amazon-emr-eks-managed-apache-flink-public-preview/)
    * Customers who already use EMR can now run their Apache Flink application along with other types of applications on the same Amazon EKS cluster.
    * To learn more and get started, please visit the Apache Flink section in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/run-flink-jobs.html).
* [Amazon GuardDuty introduces cluster configurability in EKS Runtime Monitoring](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/09/amazon-guardduty-cluster-configurability-eks-monitoring/)
    * Now you can selectively configure which Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters are to be monitored for threat detection.
* [AWS Identity and Access Management provides action last accessed information for more than 140 services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/09/aws-identity-access-management-action-last-accessed-information/)
    * You can use action last accessed information as part of your periodic review process to restrict the access granted to IAM roles, _including roles assigned to pods with IRSA_, to just the required permissions.
* [Amazon CloudWatch adds Amazon EKS control plane logs as Vended Logs](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/09/amazon-cloudwatch-eks-control-plane-vended-logs/)
    * EKS control plane logs can be routed to different backends, e.g. Kinesis Firehose, S3, etc and can take advantage of volume-based tiered pricing for CloudWatch Logs.
## AWS blogs
* [Automate Packet Acceleration configuration using DPDK on Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/automate-packet-acceleration-configuration-using-dpdk-on-amazon-eks/)
    * Explains how to install and configure SRIOV and DPDK to optimize workloads for maximum network throughput.
* [Blog] [Maximizing GPU utilization with NVIDIAâ€™s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) on Amazon EKS: Running more pods per GPU for enhanced performance](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/maximizing-gpu-utilization-with-nvidias-multi-instance-gpu-mig-on-amazon-eks-running-more-pods-per-gpu-for-enhanced-performance/)
    * Explains how to configure and optimize the NVIDIA multi-instance GPU (MIG) device plugin on EKS worker nodes so you can derive the most value from each GPU.
* [KB Article] [External Traffic Fails to Reach EKS Pods with NLB Client IP Preservation](https://repost.aws/articles/ARNVGzI4YlSGuoP_UnxCBY-w)
* [Tutorials] The first [five tutorials](https://community.aws/tags/eks-cluster-setup) in this series walk you through different EKS cluster setups.
* [Blog] [GPU sharing on Amazon EKS with NVIDIA time-slicing and accelerated EC2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/gpu-sharing-on-amazon-eks-with-nvidia-time-slicing-and-accelerated-ec2-instances/)
    * Time-slicing refers to the method where multiple tasks or processes share the GPU resources in small time intervals, ensuring efficient utilization and task concurrency.
    * Time-slicing becomes important in scenarios where GPU demands are dynamic, where multiple tasks or users need concurrent access, or where maximizing the efficiency of GPU resources is a priority.
    * This blog explains how to enable GPU sharing on EKS with the NVIDIA Kubernetes device plugin.
* [Deploy Generative AI Models on Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/deploy-generative-ai-models-on-amazon-eks/)
    * This post walks you through an end-to-end stack (JARK) and example (Dreambooth) for building Generative AI systems on Amazon EKS.
* [Run Spark-RAPIDS ML workloads with GPUs on Amazon EMR on EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/run-spark-rapids-ml-workloads-with-gpus-on-amazon-emr-on-eks/)
    * To enhance the capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs within the Spark ecosystem, NVIDIA developed Spark-RAPIDS. 
    * Spark-RAPIDS is an extension library that uses RAPIDS libraries built on CUDA, to enable high-performance data processing and ML training on GPUs.
    * Starting from Amazon EMR on EKS 6.9, customers can use the power of the NVIDIA Spark-RAPIDS Accelerator without the need for creating and maintaining custom images.
    * This post explores the capabilities of the NVIDIA Spark-RAPIDS Accelerator and its impact on the ML workflow using Apache Spark.
* [Argo CD Application Controller Scalability Testing on Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/argo-cd-application-controller-scalability-testing-on-amazon-eks/)
    * This post builds on prior work done by the industry to look at the scalability of Argo CD. 
    * It presents the findings from experiments of deploying 10,000 Argo CD applications to 1, 10, and 97 remote clusters. 
    * It includes observed scalability bottlenecks and modifications that were made to improved our efforts to scale Argo CD on any Kubernetes cluster, including Amazon EKS.
## Community news
* [Policy management in Kubernetes is changing](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/09/14/policy-management-in-kubernetes-is-changing/)
    * In Kubernetes 1.28 you can use Kubernetes [Validating Admission Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/) to define policies in a Kubernetes native way using the [Common Expression Language](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) (CEL)
* [AI for Kubernetes; good or evil?](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/09/05/ai-for-kubernetes-good-or-evil/)
