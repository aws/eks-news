In this edition we feature several key announcements related to Amazon EKS including but not limited to upgrade insights checks, support for community add-ons and support for Bottlerocket FIPS AMIs in Managed Node Groups.

## New AWS services and features

* [Amazon EKS now enforces upgrade insights checks as part of cluster upgrades](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-eks-enforces-upgrade-insights-check-cluster-upgrades/)
  * EKS upgrade insights automatically scan clusters against a list of potential Kubernetes version upgrade impacting issues such as deprecated Kubernetes API usage.
  * With this new control, EKS will prevent you from upgrading the EKS clusters if there are any Kubernetes version upgrade impacting issues surfaced by EKS upgrade insights.

* [Amazon EKS introduces a new catalog of community add-ons](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-eks-new-catalog-community-add-ons/)
  * To make Kubernetes clusters production-ready, you need to integrate various operational tools and add-ons.
  * With this launch, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) now offers a new catalog of community add-ons that includes metrics-server, kube-state-metrics, cert-manager, prometheus-node-exporter, and external-dns.
  * Each add-on has been packaged, scanned, and validated for compatibility by EKS, with container images securely hosted in an EKS-owned private Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository.

* [Amazon EKS Adds Support for Bottlerocket FIPS AMIs in Managed Node Groups](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/04/amazon-eks-bottlerocket-fips-amis-node-groups/)
  * Bottlerocket is a Linux-based operating system optimized for running containers that follows a minimal, immutable design for enhanced security and performance. The FIPS-enabled Bottlerocket AMIs for EKS include FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules and are configured by default to use FIPS-enabled AWS service endpoints, making it easier for customers in regulated industries to run containerized workloads while maintaining compliance with federal standards.
  * With this launch, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) now offers Bottlerocket FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) AMIs for EKS managed node groups.
