**Attention readers**: On Monday, March 20th, traffic from the older k8s.gcr.io registry will be automatically redirected to registry.k8s.io with the eventual goal of sunsetting k8s.gcr.io. If you think you will be impacted by this change, please see *k8s.gcr.io Redirect to registry.k8s.io - What You Need to Know* under Community News. Please stop using k8s.gcr.io before the deadline, April 3rd. 

For this edition of the newsletter, we've purposely included several resources, including a few that have appeared in the newsletter previously, that help explain how CPU sharing works on Kubernetes/Linux. This is an important topic to understand because CPU requests/limits can directly impact application performance, cluster utilization, compute costs, and scaling behavior. 

## New AWS services and features
* [Amazon EKS is now available in the Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/amazon-eks-asia-pacific-melbourne-region/)

## New AWS blogs

    * This blog explores different options for backing up Kubernetes resources when using GitOps and Crossplane for infrastructure provisioning. It specifically looks at what you should do when you need to bring up a new cluster after the control plane fails, how to restore resources in a different AWS region, and what to do when a resource managed by Crossplane fails. 
* [Validating OpenTelemetry Configuration Files with the otel-config-validator](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/validating-opentelemetry-configuration-files-with-the-otel-config-validator/)
    * A new [validation tool](https://github.com/lightstep/otel-config-validator) has been co-developed by AWS and Lightstep to verify the syntax of the OTEL configuration files.
