In this issue we learn that Kubernetes 1.24 "Stargazer" is out, console supporting all standard Kubernetes resources, some save the dates, ways to write less YAML and so much more.

The schedule for [AWS Container Days](https://awscontainerdayseurope.splashthat.com/) is out! Give it a look and register if you'd like us to send you calendar invites. See the page for more details

## New service announcements and features

[Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is now available in Europe (London) Region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/05/amazon-managed-service-prometheus-now-available-europe-london-region/)

[Introducing Kubernetes Resource View in Amazon EKS console](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-kubernetes-resource-view-in-amazon-eks-console/)

* You will now be able to see all Kubernetes API resource types running in your Amazon EKS cluster using the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) for Amazon EKS, making it easier to visualize and troubleshoot your Kubernetes applications using Amazon EKS

[Using AWS Load Balancer Controller for blue/green deployment, canary deployment and A/B testing](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-aws-load-balancer-controller-for-blue-green-deployment-canary-deployment-and-a-b-testing/)

* In the past, our customers have commonly used solutions such as Flagger, service mesh, or CI/CD to enable blue/green deployment, A/B testing, and traffic management. The [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html) (formerly known as ALB Ingress Controller) enables EKS users to realize blue/green deployments, A/B testing, and canary deployments via the Kubernetes ingress resources with the native support of the AWS Application Load Balancer

[Addressing latency and data transfer costs on EKS using Istio](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/addressing-latency-and-data-transfer-costs-on-eks-using-istio/)

* Data transfer charges are often overlooked when operating [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) clusters; understanding these charges would help reduce cost while operating your workload on Amazon EKS at production scale
* Numerous cost savings measures are detailed in this blog post

[Metrics and traces Collection from Amazon ECS using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with Dynamic Service Discovery](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/metrics-and-traces-collection-from-amazon-ecs-using-aws-distro-for-opentelemetry-with-dynamic-service-discovery/)

* Set up an Amazon ECS cluster on Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate and enable service discovery by creating service registries in AWS Cloud Map
* Deploy an instance of ADOT Collector to the cluster. The collector has a _metrics_ pipeline that comprises a [Prometheus Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver) and an [AWS Prometheus Remote Write Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awsprometheusremotewriteexporter) as shown in the figure. This enables it to collect Prometheus metrics from workloads and send them to a workspace in Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus
* Deploy a sidecar application alongside the ADOT Collector to help discover the services registered in AWS Cloud Map and dynamically update the scrape configurations used by the Prometheus Receiver
* Deploy application services to the cluster and register them with a service registry in AWS Cloud Map. The current implementation uses a stateless web application that is instrumented with [Prometheus Go client library](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) as a representative workload. This application exposes a [Counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter) named _http_requests_total_ and a [Histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) named _request_duration_milliseconds_
* Optionally, deploy an instance of [ECS Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/ecs_exporter) alongside the application container in order to expose task-level system metrics in addition to custom application metrics
* Visualize metrics data using [Amazon Managed Grafana](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/?id=docs_gateway)
* Deploy application services instrumented with X-Ray SDK and send trace data to the ADOT Collector instance. The collector has a _traces_ pipeline as shown in the figure which comprises an instance of [AWS X-Ray Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/awsxrayreceiver) and [AWS X-Ray Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awsxrayexporter) which enables it to collect the trace segments and send them to AWS X-Ray
