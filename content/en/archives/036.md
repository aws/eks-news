* [Reducing Fargate startup times with zstd compressed container images](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/reducing-aws-fargate-startup-times-with-zstd-compressed-container-images/)
    * New compression format (zdtd) can achieve higher compression ratios and higher decompression speeds than the gzip compression algorithm
    * Reduced start times for Fargate pods by 27%
* [Canary testing with AWS App Mesh and Tekton](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/canary-testing-with-aws-app-mesh-and-tekton/)
    * A Canary deployment is a deployment strategy that releases a new software version in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users
    * In this blog post the authors use AWS App Mesh to configure traffic flows between services
    * They also use separate Tekton pipelines, based on different personas, to separate the duties of the developement and operations teams thereby enabling team productivity and velocity
