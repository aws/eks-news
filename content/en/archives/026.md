## AWS Container Announcements
* [AWS Fault Injection Simulator now supports ChaosMesh and Litmus experiments](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/07/aws-fault-injection-simulator-supports-chaosmesh-litmus-experiments/)

## AWS Container Blogs
* [Using Amazon EBS snapshots for persistent storage with your Amazon EKS cluster by leveraging add-ons](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-amazon-ebs-snapshots-for-persistent-storage-with-your-amazon-eks-cluster-by-leveraging-add-ons/)
    * A very timely article considering the pending release of EKS 1.23 where installation of the EBS CSI driver will be required 
    * The CSI driver includes support for Kubernetes Volume Snapshots which lets you create a copy of your Amazon EBS volume at a specific point in time
    * The snapshotter is a separate component that has to be installed prior to the EKS add-on for the EBS CSI driver
    * Once the snapshotter is installed, you can use a CRD to create an EBS snapshot
    * You can use snapshots to migrate your EBS volumes from gp2 to gp3 as described in this earlier [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/migrating-amazon-eks-clusters-from-gp2-to-gp3-ebs-volumes/)

* [Using CDK to perform continuous deployments in multi-region Kubernetes environments](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-cdk-to-perform-continuous-deployments-in-multi-region-kubernetes-environments/)
    * This post shows you how to create EKS clusters in multiple AWS Regions using CDK and create a continuous deployment pipeline for infrastructure and application changes
    * [Kubernetes Multi-Region with CDK Lightboard Video](https://youtu.be/V6nWdCoSKTg)
    * If you prefer a declarative approach to provisioning and managing infrastructure consider these options:
        * [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/)
        * [ACK](https://aws-controllers-k8s.github.io/community/docs/community/overview/)
        * [EKS Blueprints](https://aws-ia.github.io/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/main/)

* [Optimize your Spring Boot application for AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/optimize-your-spring-boot-application-for-aws-fargate/)
    * Shorten the time to bootstrap your container and the application by following these recommendations: 
        * Use only the required dependencies
        * Replace Tomcat with Undertow, which is a more lightweight and performant web container
        * Use the standard DynamoDB client instead of the enhanced client
        * Use Amazon Corretto 18 and build your own runtime using jdeps and jlink
        * Add GraalVM with Spring Native, GraalVM is a high-performance distribution of the JDK and transforms bytecode into machine code
        * Use quay.io/quarkus/quarkus-distroless-image as the parent image for x86
