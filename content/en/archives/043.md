The beginning of a new year is an opportunity for reflection. That certainly applies to technology. This edition features content on the top 30 CNCF projects of 2022 and the best DevOps tools you should consider using in 2023. It also reflects the importance of cost optimization in today's economy. If the economy has got you down, we've included a couple of fun things to distract you for a little while.
