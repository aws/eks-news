This edition features 2 technologies powered by eBPF: native network policies using the VPC CNI plugin and the GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring agent. 

Network policies can be enabled on all new EKS clusters v1.25 and above. 

## New AWS services and features

* [Amazon VPC CNI now supports Kubernetes NetworkPolicy enforcement](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/08/amazon-vpc-cni-kubernetes-networkpolicy-enforcement/)
    * Starting with VPC CNI v1.14, customers running Kubernetes on AWS can now allow or deny traffic between their pods based on label selectors, namespaces, IP blocks, and ports. 
    * Customers can also trace and troubleshoot configured policies at a cluster and node level using the Amazon VPC CNI plugin. 
    * NetworkPolicy support is available on new clusters running Kubernetes version 1.25 and above but turned off by default at launch.
