I know we mentioned the `Dockershim` removal effort in upstream Kubernetes last week. As I was working on the EKS 1.22 release blog this week, I wanted to make sure EKS customers were aware of what EKS is doing related to `Dockershim`. EKS has made `containerd` available as of version 1.21. You can kick the tires on `containerd` now by adding the `--container-runtime containerd` option to your user data. [Amazon EKS is removing `Dockershim` support in version 1.23](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/dockershim-deprecation.html). Quoting the linked User Guide, "The `containerd` runtime provides better performance and security, and it's the runtime we're standardizing on across Amazon EKS. Fargate and Bottlerocket already use `containerd` only." I mention this now because it's never too early to start planning for this significant change.

This week we'll talk about UDP traffic on Kubernetes (supertuxcart is involved), running Windows workloads on EKS, and some of the latest nuggets from the greater cloud native ecosystem.

## New and notable blogs

[How to route UDP traffic into Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/how-to-route-udp-traffic-into-kubernetes/)

* Together, UDP, Kubernetes, and Network Load Balancers give customers the ability to improve their agility while also meeting their low latency requirements
* In the AWS Cloud, you can use the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.3/) to configure a Network Load Balancer to route TCP and UDP traffic from the internet to services running in your cluster
* The article features a step-by-step guide on building a game server on your local workstation using [supertuxkart](https://supertuxkart.net/Download)

[Running Windows workloads on a private EKS cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/running-windows-workloads-on-a-private-eks-cluster/)

* Customers want to scale Windows workloads on Kubernetes alongside their Linux workloads
* Blog post provides a step by step guide from enabling Windows support in an EKS cluster to allowing Windows worker nodes to utilize cluster internal networking to creating a Windows node group.
* If you want to jump right into the codebase there's an [AWS sample repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/private-eks-for-windows-workloads-with-terraform)
