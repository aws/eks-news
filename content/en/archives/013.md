INTRO

This week we'll discuss ...

## New service announcements and features

[Amazon EKS, Amazon EKS Distro, and Amazon EKS Anywhere now support Kubernetes version 1.22](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/amazon-eks-distro-eks-anywhere-kubernetes-1-22/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=eks-news)

* You can now use [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Amazon EKS Distro](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-distro/), and [Amazon EKS Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/) to run Kubernetes version 1.22
* Kubernetes version 1.22 release includes external credential providers, server-side apply, and bound service account token volumes graduating to stable, and warning mechanisms for deprecated API usage
* Kubernetes 1.22 removes a number of deprecated beta APIs in favor of GA versions of those same APIs. You need to ensure your applications, add ons, manifests and clients are updated to use these GA APIs to prevent workloads from potentially failing after the upgrade is complete.

## New and notable blogs

[Amazon EKS now supports Kubernetes 1.22](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-now-supports-kubernetes-1-22/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=eks-news)

* The theme for the release, according to release lead [Savitha Raghunathan](https://github.com/savitharaghunathan), is due to what she described as: "in spite of the pandemic and burnout, Kubernetes 1.22 had the highest number of enhancements in any release."
* Amazon EKS team worked hand-in-hand with etcd contributors to help verify and consistently reproduce data inconsistency issues (we're shipping version 1.22 with etcd 3.4 as a result [pending a release that mitigates these issues](https://groups.google.com/g/etcd-dev/c/sad9tgmKU7Y/m/vhArFVevBgAJ)).
* You can learn about how to upgrade your EKS version in our blog post, [Planning Kubernetes Upgrades with Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/planning-kubernetes-upgrades-with-amazon-eks/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=eks-news)
